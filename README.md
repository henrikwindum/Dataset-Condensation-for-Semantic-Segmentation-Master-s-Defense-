# Dataset Condensation for Semantic Segmentation 

## Introduction 

Welcome to the repository for the project "Dataset Condensation for Semantic Segmentation". This innovative project aims to streamline the process of semantic segmentation in machine learning by condensing large datasets into more manageable sizes without compromising the quality and integrity of the data. This approach is particularly beneficial in scenarios where computational resources are limited or when working with extremely large datasets.

## Project Overview 

Semantic segmentation, a crucial task in computer vision, involves assigning a class label to each pixel in an image. This process, while powerful, often requires substantial computational resources due to the large size of training datasets. Our project addresses this challenge by implementing dataset condensation techniques, enabling models to learn from smaller, yet representative datasets, thus reducing training time and resource usage.
